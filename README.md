With our application we want to create a platform that offers tiffin/meal prep plans that are healthy and delivered to the doorstep of our customers. Customers would be able to select from a wide range of meal plans and subscribe to them. Food service vendors can advertise their meal plans that are composed of multiple containerized and portioned meals which are delivered on a weekly basis to their customers.
